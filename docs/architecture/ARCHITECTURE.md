# Architecture

`mery-tts-server` is a **standalone Python application** with a strict layered
architecture. It is designed to be: **SoC-clean, modular, standalone, scalable, and
adaptive** — meaning it works independently of Zam Reader, supports multiple engines
without coupling, runs on CPU/GPU/ANE hardware, and can be packaged in multiple ways
without changing its internal structure.

---

## Design principles

| Principle | What it means here |
|---|---|
| **Separation of Concerns** | Each module has one explicit job. API routes do not own domain logic. Engines do not own storage. Security does not know about engines. |
| **Hexagonal / Ports & Adapters** | Domain core (engine adapters, model manager, catalog, diagnostics) has no dependency on FastAPI, CLI, or filesystem paths. Infrastructure adapters (API, CLI, audio, storage) live at the edges. |
| **Modular engines** | Each TTS engine is a self-contained adapter behind a common `EngineAdapter` ABC. Adding a new engine means adding one subdirectory under `engines/`; nothing else changes. |
| **Standalone** | The helper is fully testable and usable without Zam Reader. `mery speak --play` works with no extension present. Contract tests run against a fake engine with no model download. |
| **Scalable** | New engines, voices, locales, and catalog sources can be added without modifying existing code. `EngineRegistry` and `ModelManager` are open for extension, closed for modification. |
| **Adaptive** | The transport layer (localhost HTTP now, Native Messaging later) is behind an abstraction. The packaging method (uv, standalone binary, signed installer) does not affect internal structure. The hardware backend (CPU/ANE/GPU) is chosen by the engine adapter, invisible to callers. |

## Module dependency graph (allowed → arrows)

```text
cli/            → api/, engines/, models/, catalog/, security/, diagnostics/, settings/, schemas/
api/routes/     → engines/, models/, catalog/, security/, diagnostics/, settings/, schemas/
api/ws/         → engines/voice_registry, security/, schemas/   ← WS handler via VoiceRegistry only
engines/base    → schemas/v1/, settings/
engines/voice_registry → engines/base, schemas/v1/             ← routing concern, separate from adapter mgmt
models/         → schemas/v1/, catalog/, settings/
catalog/        → schemas/v1/, settings/
security/       → schemas/v1/, settings/
diagnostics/    → schemas/v1/, engines/, models/, security/, settings/
schemas/        → (nothing inside mery_tts)
settings/       → (nothing inside mery_tts)
audio/          → settings/
```

**Strict prohibitions:**

- `engines/` never imports `api/` — engines do not know the server exists
- `api/ws/` never imports `engines/base` directly — routes through `VoiceRegistry` only
- `models/` never imports `engines/` — model storage is engine-agnostic
- `catalog/` never imports `engines/` or `models/` — catalog is pure data
- `schemas/` never imports anything from `mery_tts` — no circular deps
- No module imports from `tests/` or `scripts/`
- `engines/voice_registry` never imports `api/` or `models/` — it is a pure routing index

## Engine adapter contract

All TTS engines implement the same ABC. The API layer and CLI speak only to this
interface; they never know whether they are using Piper-plus or Kokoro.

```python
# engines/base.py (simplified)
from abc import ABC, abstractmethod
from collections.abc import AsyncIterator
from mery_tts.schemas.v1 import EngineDescriptor, PCMChunk, VoiceDescriptor

class EngineAdapter(ABC):

    @property
    @abstractmethod
    def engine_id(self) -> str: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def health(self) -> EngineStatus: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def voices(self) -> list[VoiceDescriptor]: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def synthesize(
        self,
        text: str,
        voice_id: str,
        session_id: str,
    ) -> AsyncIterator[PCMChunk]: ...

    @abstractmethod
    async def cancel(self, session_id: str) -> None: ...
```

### Async synthesis bridge (blocking inference → `AsyncIterator[PCMChunk]`)

Engine libraries (piper-plus, kokoro-onnx) are **synchronous**. The adapter bridges
this to the async interface via `run_in_executor` + `asyncio.Queue`:

```python
# engines/piper_plus/model_runner.py (pattern)
class PiperPlusModelRunner:
    def __init__(self) -> None:
        self._thread_pool = ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=2)
        self._cancel_tokens: dict[str, CancelToken] = {}

    async def synthesize_stream(
        self, text: str, voice_id: str, session_id: str
    ) -> AsyncIterator[PCMChunk]:
        token = CancelToken()
        self._cancel_tokens[session_id] = token
        queue: asyncio.Queue[PCMChunk | None] = asyncio.Queue()
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

        def _blocking() -> None:
            for chunk in self._model.synthesize(text, voice_id):   # blocking
                if token.is_cancelled:
                    break
                loop.call_soon_threadsafe(queue.put_nowait, chunk)
            loop.call_soon_threadsafe(queue.put_nowait, None)      # sentinel

        loop.run_in_executor(self._thread_pool, _blocking)
        while (item := await queue.get()) is not None:
            yield item
        self._cancel_tokens.pop(session_id, None)

    def cancel(self, session_id: str) -> None:
        if token := self._cancel_tokens.get(session_id):
            token.cancel()
```

**SoC split:**
- `model_runner.py` — owns threading, `ThreadPoolExecutor`, `CancelToken` registry
- `adapter.py` — owns `EngineAdapter` protocol, `session_id` lifecycle, delegates to runner
- `base.py` — owns `CancelToken` dataclass (shared across all engine adapters)

Concurrent sessions do not conflict: each `session_id` gets its own `CancelToken`.

`EngineRegistry` discovers adapters at startup via Python **entry-points** (group
`"mery_tts.engines"`). Each adapter registers itself in `pyproject.toml`; the
registry never imports any adapter directly — it loads them via
`importlib.metadata.entry_points`. This means:

- Adding a new engine = new subdirectory + one line in `pyproject.toml`. Zero changes to `EngineRegistry`.
- Third-party engines can be installed as separate packages and self-register.
- Adapters that fail to load (missing optional-extra) are skipped with a warning; the registry degrades gracefully.

**Entry-points is the single discovery mechanism — no dev-mode fallback.**
Entry-points are only registered once the package is installed (`uv sync` / `pip install -e .`).
Running the helper without installing first is a misconfigured environment, not a supported
shortcut. `mery doctor` checks for available engines and emits a clear structured diagnostic
if none are found — the failure is explicit, not silent.

This keeps production and development on an identical code path. No env-branching, no
conditional imports, no DI bypass. `just install` is documented as step one of first-run setup
precisely because it is a hard prerequisite.

**Tests use `FakeEngineAdapter` injected directly via `conftest.py` fixtures** — they bypass
`EngineRegistry` discovery entirely. Tests never depend on entry-points being registered,
which keeps unit/contract tests fast and hermetic.

After discovery, `EngineRegistry` checks health of each loaded adapter, caches
their descriptors, and returns them without exposing internals.

## Data flow: synthesize request (extension mode)

```text
Zam Reader
  LocalTTSBridge.synthesize(text, voiceId, sessionId)
  → POST /v1/events (WS, already connected)
    sends: { type: "synthesize.request", sessionId, voiceId, text }

API ws/events.py
  → authenticate request (token in WS handshake header)
  → VoiceRegistry.resolve(voiceId) → (EngineAdapter, VoiceDescriptor)
      VoiceRegistry is injected; ws/events.py never touches EngineRegistry directly
  → adapter.synthesize(text, voiceId, sessionId) → AsyncIterator[PCMChunk]
  → async for chunk in stream:
      emit audio.chunk event with base64 PCM16 payload
  → emit audio.done event

Zam Reader
  → buffers chunks, decodes PCM16
  → plays via Web Audio / offscreen document
  → emits PlaybackEvent.utteranceStarted / wordBoundary / done
```

**SRP split:**
- `EngineRegistry` — owns adapter lifecycle (discovery, health, load/unload)
- `VoiceRegistry` — owns voice→engine routing; refreshed on model install/delete
  - **Refresh model: copy-on-write.** `refresh()` builds a new routing dict then atomically
    swaps `_routing`. Active synthesis sessions retain their adapter reference (Python object
    lifetime) until the stream completes — no lock, no session tracking, correct by construction.
- `ws/events.py` — owns WS protocol; depends on `VoiceRegistry` only, not `EngineRegistry`

---

## Data flow: model install

```text
Zam Reader
  → POST /v1/models/install  { modelId: "piper-plus.en-us.lessac.medium" }
  ← { jobId: "...", status: "queued" }

API routes/models.py
  → delegates request to api/orchestrators/model_install.py

API orchestrator model_install.py
  → async for event in ModelManager.install(modelId):
      → translate InstallEvent domain event to WS /v1/events schema
      → emit install.progress / install.done / install.failed
      → on InstallDone: VoiceRegistry.refresh()

models/manager.py
  → exposes AsyncIterator[InstallEvent]
  → CatalogManager.resolve(modelId)           # get URL, sha256, sizeBytes
  → security: verify URL against allowlist
  → download to cache/temp/ via httpx streaming
  → yield InstallProgress(jobId, modelId, phase, percent, bytesDownloaded, totalBytes)
  → ModelVerifier.verify(file, sha256, size)
    → on fail: delete temp, yield InstallFailed(jobId, modelId, error)
  → atomic move to models/piper-plus/en-us.lessac.medium/
  → update model store index
  → yield InstallDone(jobId, modelId, installedPath)
```

**Boundary rule:** `ModelManager` owns the install state machine and emits a standalone
`AsyncIterator[InstallEvent]` domain stream. It does not import `api/`, WebSocket
schemas, or `VoiceRegistry`. The API orchestrator is the only component that knows
both `ModelManager` and WS concerns; it performs protocol translation and refreshes
`VoiceRegistry` after `InstallDone`.

## Localhost security model (summary)

Full design in `docs/architecture/SECURITY_MODEL.md` and ADR-0006.

```text
Network
  bind only 127.0.0.1 / ::1
  never bind 0.0.0.0

Authentication
  per-install token in config.json
  every REST request: Authorization: Bearer <token>
  every WS connection: token in Sec-WebSocket-Protocol header

CORS / Origin
  allowlist of configured extension origins
  no wildcard *
  reject unknown origins

Request hardening
  request body: ≤ 100 KB
  text input: ≤ 10 000 chars
  rate limits: 60 req/min synthesize, 10 req/min install
  model IDs only — no raw filesystem paths from client

Pairing
  one-time code, 10-minute TTL
  POST /v1/pair/claim exchanges code → long-lived token
  code invalidated after first valid claim
```

---

## Cross-platform and packaging adaptability

The helper is **packaging-agnostic**. The same code runs in:

| Mode | How it is launched | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `uv tool install` / `pipx` | `mery serve` in terminal | Phase 1 default |
| Standalone binary (PyInstaller/Nuitka) | Double-click or CLI path | Phase 2 |
| Signed `.pkg` / `.dmg` | macOS installer with launchd | Phase 3 (optional) |

The `settings/config.py` module resolves OS-correct app data paths via `platformdirs`
at runtime. No path is hardcoded; no packaging method changes the internal behavior.

Engine adapter dependencies are **optional extras** in `pyproject.toml`:

```toml
[project.optional-dependencies]
piper-plus = ["piper-plus>=1.10.0"]
kokoro     = ["kokoro-onnx>=0.4"]
all        = ["mery-tts-server[piper-plus,kokoro]"]
```

This means the helper core can be installed without any engine. Engines are pulled
in per-user need. `mery doctor` reports which engines are available.

---

## Adaptive hardware path

Each engine adapter selects its compute backend transparently:

| Engine | CPU | Apple ANE / CoreML | CUDA GPU |
|---|---|---|---|
| Piper-plus | ✅ Default (ONNX Runtime) | Planned (CoreML EP) | Possible (CUDA EP) |
| Kokoro | ✅ Default (kokoro-onnx CPU) | Planned | Possible |

The API surface, schemas, and WS events are identical regardless of hardware.
Zam Reader never knows which backend is active.

---

## Test architecture

Tests are layered to match the code layers. Each layer tests only what it owns.

```text
tests/unit/        → pure logic, no I/O, no server, no engine binary
tests/contract/    → REST + WS shape tests against TestClient (fake engine)
tests/engine/      → adapter contract tests (requires engine installed, CI-optional)
tests/integration/ → full server + real fixture model + WS event ordering
tests/cli/         → CLI command output + exit codes
```

The fake engine fixture in `conftest.py` implements `EngineAdapter` with a hard-coded
PCM sine wave. All contract tests use it. No model download ever happens in unit or
contract tests.

See `docs/TECH_STACK.md` for testing tools and CI strategy.
